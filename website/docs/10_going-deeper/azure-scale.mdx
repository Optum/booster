# Scaling Booster Azure Functions

Booster Azure Provider relies on CosmosDB [change feed processor](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cosmos-db/nosql/change-feed-processor) to consume new events.
In CosmosDB, the partition keys are distributed in ranges, where each range represents a physical partition. [Unlike logical partitions,
physical partitions are an internal implementation of the system and Azure Cosmos DB entirely manages physical partitions](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cosmos-db/partitioning-overview#physical-partitions)

With Booster EventStream functionality, we could define the number of physical partitions our events are split and create instances for each partition.

To enable EventStream, set the `EventStreamConfiguration` in the configuration object:

> **Warning**: Currently, only available for Azure provider.

```typescript
  config.eventStreamConfiguration = {
    enabled: true,
    parameters: {
      streamTopic: 'test',
      partitionCount: 3,
      messageRetention: 1,
    },
  }
```

## Parameters
* StreamTopic: Define the internal topic name Booster will use.
* PartitionCount: Number of Event Hub partitions. The number of functions app consumer instances will match the partition count
* MessageRetention: Specifies the number of days to retain the events for this Event Hub

## Infrastructure

Enabling `EventStreamConfiguration` will apply some changes to the infrastructure:

* Two functions will be created
  * One function with a CosmosDB consumer that will produce Event Hubs events. Also, it will include the readModels functions, schedule functions app, etc...
  * One function with an Event Hub consumer function app. This function will allow you to define the number of instances to be created
* A new container to handle duplicated consumed events
* A new Event Hub will be added for event handling.
