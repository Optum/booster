## How to contribute to the design process

Everyone is welcome to propose, discuss, and review ideas to improve Booster in the `#proposals` channel of the Discord server.

Note that the project is in a very early stage, and the contribution to the design process is not well defined.

As some general rules for now, take this into account before submitting a proposal:

- No "What about if Booster does a 180-degree turn and instead does this completely unrelated thing?". These kinds of proposals are **seen as completely out of the scope of the Booster project and will be instantly dismissed.**
- **Use constructive criticism.** Instead of "remove this, I don't like it", take a moment to think and give actual reasons like "I believe that this function in the standard library is not clear enough, someone could understand this in a wrong way"
- Is the problem being addressed **impactful enough** to warrant a change to Booster?
- How does this impact the [**Principle of Least Astonishment**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principle_of_least_astonishment) of the project?
- How does this impact the [**Principle of Developer Happiness**](https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbestechcouncil/2023/09/22/ensuring-developer-happiness-how-to-hang-on-to-software-engineers) of the project?
- How does this impact the [**Principle of Least Effort**](https://simplicable.com/design/principle-of-least-effort) of the project? Both externally for the users and internally for the maintainers.
- Does this proposal fit well with the **feel and direction** of Booster?
- What **other libraries/languages** got you inspired to submit this proposal? How does this compare to those?
- How much **effort** did you put into your review? A glance, a quick reading, or an in-depth study?

Please **state explicitly** whether you believe that the proposal should be accepted into Booster.
