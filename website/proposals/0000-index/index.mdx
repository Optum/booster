:::caution STATUS - DRAFT
:::

This BEEP will contain the index of all **Booster Evolution Enhancement Proposals**, known as BEEPs. BEEP numbers are assigned by the BEEP editors, and once assigned are never changed.

In the future, the BEEPs will be listed here by category. For now, use the sidebar on the left.

A good starting point is [BEEP 1](./0001-purpose-and-guidelines), which describes the BEEP process itself.
